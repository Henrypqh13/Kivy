This app allows us to \n carry out an initial diagnostic of your health \n using a Ruffier test.
A Ruffier test is a stress test\n intended to evaluate the efficiency of the heart during physical strain.\n
The user calculates their pulse frequency over 15 seconds.\n
Then the user does 30 squats over the course of 45 seconds.\n
After the end of the strain, the pulse is calculated again: \n the number of pulsations after the first 15 seconds, 30 seconds of rest,\n and the number of pulsations over the last 15 seconds.\n'''
